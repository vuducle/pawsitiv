# Pawsitiv – A Home for Every Cat

<p> We wanted to create an App where you can wander the Landscape and find stray cats. If you´re the first person to find the cat you can create a profile for the cat. Then everyone can see the status of the cat and different intel about her

- Name or Nickname
- food status
- adopted/still looking for a home

  With information like this you could get the common Area the cat moves in and it would simplify taking care of the cats if organisations like the PETA can get those infos to provide vaccine shots or take care.

## WIP

## SSL and certificates
WSL (and Docker obviously) is required for Windows-based systems.
```
cd server
mkdir -p secrets

sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048     
  -keyout secrets/nginx-selfsigned.key     
  -out secrets/nginx-selfsigned.crt     
  -subj "/C=US/ST=YourState/L=YourCity/O=YourOrganization/OU=YourDepartment/CN=localhost"

```
